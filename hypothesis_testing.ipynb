    "![mic-check](images/micCheck.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinarily, when we tend to turn to science if we want to determine a certain phenomenon about the exists in the world. Science is built upon the idea of testing this phenomenon through conducting experiments so as to learn about the same phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics and Data science employ the same techniques through a statistical process that we call **hypothesis test**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment Design \n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments are how we get data needed to determine if indeed the observations made are worthwhile. Whenever you have a poorly designed experiment, you will most definitely have wrong results and inturn the insights you generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "   >> 📝 \n",
    "   We typically use the term *experiment* when doing a hypothesis test which tend to be a little confusing when the data has been collected before any other step. This should be fine but be should consider if this experiment follows a general criteria of a \"good\" design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scientific Method\n",
    "\n",
    "One should consider if the question you're looking to answer can be investigated with the **scientific method**. There is no completely agreed upon \"scientific method\" but the following should help us know if we're on the right track:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question/Observation\n",
    "* Background Knowledge\n",
    "* Hypothesis formulating \n",
    "* Experiment and Data Collection\n",
    "* Analysis\n",
    "* Draw Conclusions \n",
    "\n",
    "### Making a Good Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Although unrealistic, we strive to make a perfectly designed experiment that would test every possible answer to a question. An experiment doesn't have to fulfill everything to still be useful, though the more items off the checkoff list the more certain of the results. Below are a few items to consider for a good experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Treatment Group**\n",
    ">>In the design of experiments, hypotheses are applied to experimental units in a treatment group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control Groups**\n",
    ">>Refers to the standard to which comparisons are made in an experiment. The members of a control group receive a standard treatment, a placebo, or no treatment at all. Your experiment should consider other factors that could affect the outcome and try to account for (or control) those factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Trials** \n",
    ">>By having random trials/samples, you're less likely to have bias in your observations/data.\n",

    "**Sample Size**\n",
    ">>A large enough sample size that we can reasonably extrapolate to the population of interest.\n",

    "### What is a hypothesis Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a statistical procedure, that allows you to use a sample to draw conclusions about an entire population by evaluating two mutually exclusive statements about the population and determines which statement the data supports. These two statements are the hypotheses that the procedure tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition Behind Hypothesis Test\n",
    "Suppose we gather a sample data, and we then want to find out whether the sample is a good representation of some known population. How can we then make an appropriate guess about how representative the sample is of that population?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "Imagine we're driving down the road of our hometown and see a local high school's school bus broken down at the side of the road. All of the students are safely waiting outside of the bus and you notice that they seem a bit on the taller side.\n",
    "\n",
    "You wonder if these students are representative of the full student body or are particularly special in terms of height (maybe they could all be on the basketball team 🏀).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can quantify how _\"weird\"_ this group is compared to the student body knowing/measuring the means and standard deviations of the population and sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is at heart what hypothesis testing is: ***\"Does our sample come from the population or is it a special set?\"***\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we already know that high school students are on average $65$ inches with a standard deviation of $3$ inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we measured everyone on that bus, we would have found that their average height was $73$ inches. Through standardization, we know then the $z$-score for these particular students is $\\frac{73-65}{3}=\\frac{8}{3}\\approx 2.7$.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the empirical (68–95–99.7) rule for normal distributions there is only roughly a $0.1\\%$ chance that the sample came from the same population, because it is roughly 3 standard deviations above the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Hypothesis Testing Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "This refers to the difference between the population value and the null hypothesis value, also known as the *population effect* or *difference*.\n",
    "Example: *The mean difference between the health outcome for a treatment group and a control group is the effect*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance Level (Alpha $\\alpha$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Defines how strong the sample evidence must be to conclude an effect exists in the population. It acts as an evidentiary standard that researchers set before the study. It specifies how\n",
    "strongly the sample evidence must contradict the null hypothesis before you can reject the null for the entire population. \n",
    "Example: *A significance level of 0.05 signifies a 5% risk of deciding that an effect exists when it does not exist*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P-values\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicates the strength of sample evidence agaist the null hypothesis where, if it is less than the significance level, your results are statistically significant. \n",
    "\n",
    "P-values tell you how strongly your sample data contradict the null where lower p-values represent stronger evidence against the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical terminology for making the decision to accept or reject null hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "* When the p-value is greater than the significance level, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "When your P-value is less than the significance level, your results are statistically significant. This condition indicates the strength of the evidence in your sample (*p-value*) exceeds the evidentiary standard you defined (*significance level*).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence intervals (CIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "In inferential statistics, a principal goal is to estimate population parameters. These parameters are the unknown values for the entire\n",
    "population, such as the population mean and standard deviation. These parameter values are not only unknown but almost always unknowable. Typically, it’s impossible to measure an entire population. The sampling error I mentioned earlier produces uncertainty, or a margin of error, around our estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals incorporate the uncertainty and sample error to create a range of values the actual population value is like to fall within. For example, a confidence interval of [176 186] indicates that we can be confident that the real population mean falls within this range."
